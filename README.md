Predictive models using various basic supervised classification algorithms

#### Created by: Ristanti Ramadanti

A template i created to help my (future) self building classification model not from scratch.
Classification algorithms are supervised learning technique to predict classes. 
Examples of implementations are for fraud detection, churn prediction, purchasing decision prediction, etc.

### Machine learning algorithm:
Binary classification model with the following algorithms:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest
    - K-Nearest neighbor
    - Gaussian Naive Bayes

### Data analytics process include:

   - Preprocessing of data: merging, cleaning, transforming (scaling), feature engineering, variable selection
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Splitting training and test set
   - Handling imbalanced data (small percentage of minority class) by using stratify splitting & oversampling technique for training set
   - Training and validating predictive models using model performance metrics:
       - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
       - Confusion matrix
       - ROC Curve
